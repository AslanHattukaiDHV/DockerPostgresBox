A Dockerfile is used for defining and building a single container image, 
whereas a docker-compose.yaml file is used for managing multiple containers 
as a cohesive application. Dockerfile provides more control and flexibility 
for customizing the container image, while Docker Compose simplifies the management 
and orchestration of multi-container applications.

Key Differences:

Scope: A Dockerfile is typically used to define and build a single Docker image, 
while a docker-compose.yaml file is used to define and manage multiple containers 
as part of a larger application stack.

Configuration Management: Dockerfile provides more fine-grained control over the container's
configuration and allows for customizing the image build process. 
Docker Compose simplifies the management of complex multi-container applications 
by centralizing the configuration in a single file.

Dependency Management: With a Dockerfile, you define the dependencies and installation steps
explicitly within the file. In contrast, Docker Compose allows you to define the interdependencies 
between containers and manages their lifecycle.

Orchestration: Docker Compose provides additional features for service orchestration, 
such as scaling containers, managing networks, and defining container dependencies. 
Dockerfile does not offer built-in orchestration capabilities.
